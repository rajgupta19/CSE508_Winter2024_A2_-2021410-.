Not rugged enough for abuse but if you take care of it, it will take care of you. Makes organization of workspace much easier because screws won't roll around. Color is good too."
1708,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Md5ihUFLL._SY88.jpg'],"We use these for everything from our acoustic bass down to our ukuleles. I know there is a smaller model available for ukes, violins, etc.; we haven't yet ordered those, but these will work on smaller instruments if one doesn't extend the feet to their maximum width. They're gentle on the instruments, and the grippy material keeps them secure.

The greatest benefit has been when writing music at the computer and needing to set a guitar down to use the keyboard/mouse - just easier for me than a hanging stand.

We have several and gave one to a friend for Christmas as well. I've used mine on stage, and it folds up small enough to fit right in my gig bag."

The bass boost is outstanding. The active pickups really allow you to adjust to the sound you want. I recommend this for anyone. If you're a beginner  like I was not too long ago, it's an excellent bass to start with. If you're on tour and/or music is making you money, this bass will be beatiful on stage. The color is a bit darker than in the picture. But, all around, this is a great buy."

They worked just fine on my daughter's mini classical guitar. They are as good quality wise as much more expensive strings I've purchased in the past. They are much softer to the touch and easier for her to learn on than my steel strings on my acoustic guitar. They came labeled with both the note name and the string number, which made putting them on easy and quick."

Tip: The bottom part that supports the guitar had a weird angle when arrived, making the guitar slide back, becoming almost 100% on a vertical.
To solve this, I assembled the product and the put a some pressure on the support frame, making it bend a little. Now my guitar sits perfectly. Check photos!"

I am blown away by the look of this neck. The stain used is just enough to highlight the grain nicely and the clear coat is darn near perfect. I figured a lot of time would be during the ""adjustment"" phase of the build. Nothing else had to be done once the neck was set and bolted on. What a pleasant surprise since in past builds I'd spent an hour or more getting them set. I've used Fender and Warmoth before that cost 3 times and more than this one. The proof had been in the pudding though. This neck has been on this guitar for over a year now. No problems. I use this guitar as a back up and play it quite frequently on gigs. I buy more!"

It is better to put it on the pedal board than gcb95. True bypass and three modes are supported, which is much better than gcb95. It would have been nice if it supported the led. team kill .."

(you can see the same little holes on each of pups) Powerful, bright sound, no noise. My old Johnson LP with ex ""EMG-ish""  pickups are now fully awake and angry in a good way. Great quality! Thanks everyone for good review."

I mainly use Fender medium picks, and have a few Fender heavy picks around. I don't have any thin picks. Itll hold 6 heavy picks or 9 medium picks. I would imagine it would hold 11 or 12 thin picks."

When I unplugged it, the actual quarter inch end broke off as I was pulling the cable out as I normally do at the end of practicing or a show, and got stuck in my amp so thanks to this, I have to spend money and time that I don't have to get my amp fixed with the broken cable and buy a better, stronger, more durable cable that won't break when I pull it out of the amp."
2836,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61EkhxlNl6L._SY88.jpg'],"This Gator guitar hanger is sturdy, attractive, and easy to install.  It comes with wall anchors for drywall, and long screws.  The hangers are rubber coated to prevent finish damage.  The instructions are simple and I had this installed in under 5 minutes.  There are no screws visible once the unit is on the wall.  I was initially worried that the guitar would hang too close to the wall, however it is a good 3.5"" away.  It did take some ""oomph"" to get the actual hanger prongs parallel to the floor, but it certainly feels solidly locked in.  I was fortunate enough to have a location where a stud was available (and I would highly recommend using a stud for the install), however 2 heavy duty screw-in wall anchors also come with the unit for drywall mounting.  I much prefer this clean look to having the guitar on a floor stand in the corner where it tends to gather dust and dog hair. Ugh."
2453,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71zJMYMpDbL._SY88.jpg'],"I bought this item because it had good reviews and it was cost effective compared to the top name brands. So far I have only used this item in a practice setting, but it does exactly as it states. I have noticed if the product is left on for several hours it gets a little warm, but it doesn't seem to be any sort of issue

12V and 18V out allows for easy hookup into those oddball pedals (just make sure you don't plug your 9V pedal into one of those slots).

I would recommend this item to anybody compiling their first pedal board. I know you can just pop a 9V battery in most pedals and away you go, but...

Running the cost comparison of this power supply to 9V batteries makes it pretty obvious that this power supply is worth every penny. Plus you never have to worry about a dead battery in your loop ruining a gig."
